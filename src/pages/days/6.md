Put Day 5 project (CSS Ribbon) into npm

Thoughts : To make it easier to include the ribbon in my next days I published into npm in order to use it via CDNs like unpkg or jsdelivr.

Things I learned :

Publishing 100-days-of-code-ribbon to npm is not allowed and is tagged as spam.
I accidentally published & unpublished hundred-days-of-code-ribbon and the package name is blocked for 24 hours, so I have to rename it to hundred-days-of-code-css-ribbon.
Just updating the readme file needs to bump the package's version :(
